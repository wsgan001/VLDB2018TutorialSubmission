%\item \textbf{Duration:} The tutorial can be formatted to either 1.5 hours or 3 hours. We propose the \textbf{1.5 hour} format. See reasoning in Section~\ref{sec:duration}.
%\item \textbf{Target Audience:} Given the amount of activity on database applied R\&D and the large number of practitioners working with semistructured data (esp. JSON) in the Bay Area, the tutorial is addressed to both academic researchers and such industry parties. The tutorial is also addressed to the database researcher and/or database practitioner who is interested in NoSQL, SQL/JSON and (broadly) semistructured data querying, although she may not be knowledgeable on the topic(s) currently.
